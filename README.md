### 1. Backend Setup (This Repository)
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ABHIHG24/petpalsBackend.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd petpalsBackend
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
5.  Start the backend server:
    ```sh

    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., port 5000).

### 2. Frontend Setup
